The *Scripting Helper* allows you to run a Groovy script, see the output or errors. You can then save multiple scripts and export the saved scripts as a zip file to import into another Liferay installation.

The [codemirror](http://codemirror.net) library is utilised as the editor and supports a range of languages and editor themes.
